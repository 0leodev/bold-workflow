# Description

- `owner`: Address that will own the new Trove.
- `ownerIndex`: Index for the owner's Trove, each trove is represented as an NFT. So if an owner has 2 troves already, and if you call the function `balanceOf(owner)` in the TroveNFT contract https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xe9b841c5d2a6a1cc927ee081f1e3bd976416f387#code and returns 2, you'd use `ownerIndex = 2` to open their 3rd trove.
- `ETHAmount`: Amount of ETH/collateral to deposit.
- `boldAmount`: Amount of BOLD to borrow.
- `upperHint`: Address hint for efficient insertion in sorted list (gas optimization) - address of Trove with higher collateral ratio than yours.
- `lowerHint`: Address hint for efficient insertion in sorted list (gas optimization) - address of Trove with lower collateral ratio than yours.
- `annualInterestRate`: Annual interest rate for the loan (user-set in v2). 
- `maxUpfrontFee`: Maximum upfront fee willing to pay.
- `addManager`: Address granted permissions for operations that add money to the trove (add collateral, pay debt).
- `removeManager`: Address granted permissions for operations that withdraw money from the trove (withdraw collateral, borrow).
- `receiver`: Address to receive the borrowed BOLD tokens, (If no receiver is set, funds go to the `owner`).

The `uint256` returned by `openTrove()` is the Trove ID.

The `owner` always retains full control and can withdraw. Setting managers with `addManager` and `removeManager` only grants additional permissions to others.

Only the `owner` or designated `removeManager` can perform **withdrawal operations**.
