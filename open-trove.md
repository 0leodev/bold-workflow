# Description

- `owner`: Address that will own the new Trove.
- `ownerIndex`: Index for the owner's Trove, each trove is represented as an NFT. So if an owner has 2 troves already, and if you call the function `balanceOf(owner)` in the TroveNFT contract https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xe9b841c5d2a6a1cc927ee081f1e3bd976416f387#code and returns 2, you'd use `ownerIndex = 2` to open their 3rd trove.
- `ETHAmount`: Amount of ETH/collateral to deposit.
- `boldAmount`: Amount of BOLD to borrow.
- `upperHint`: Address hint for efficient insertion in sorted list (gas optimization) - address of Trove with higher collateral ratio than yours.
- `lowerHint`: Address hint for efficient insertion in sorted list (gas optimization) - address of Trove with lower collateral ratio than yours.
- `annualInterestRate`: Annual interest rate for the loan (user-set in v2). 
- `maxUpfrontFee`: When first opening the loan you pay an Upfront Borrowing Fee. This fee is calculated as 7 daysâ€™ worth of average interest on the respective collateral branch. By applying this fee, borrowers are discouraged from continually closing and reopening Troves to evade redemptions, as it increases the cost of frequent adjustments.
- `addManager`: Address granted permissions for operations that add money to the trove (add collateral, pay debt).
- `removeManager`: Address granted permissions for operations that withdraw money from the trove (withdraw collateral, borrow).
- `receiver`: Address to receive the borrowed BOLD tokens, (If no receiver is set, funds go to the `owner`).

The `uint256` returned by `openTrove()` is the Trove ID.

The `owner` always retains full control and can withdraw. Setting managers with `addManager` and `removeManager` only grants additional permissions to others.

Only the `owner` or designated `removeManager` can perform **withdrawal operations**.
